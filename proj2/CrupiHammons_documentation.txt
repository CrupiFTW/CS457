ORGANIZATION:
We use folders as "databases" and files within them as "tables." Data is written to the files via creation and alteration. If table "x" is created in database "one," the file path will be "somepath/one/x"

IMPLEMENTATION:
The program uses a series of "if" and "elif" statements to decide how to handle the command. It does a string compare for the input for Create, Drop, Select, and Alter.

It does some basic error checking to ensure a database is actually selected when trying to select a table or use the database, the paths exist before trying to modify something in them, and exiting the program elegantly.

The script only imports "OS" for modifying files within different selected paths.

If a command is not entered properly, it will omit that command and allow you to continue entering commands rather than terminating.
